### Warning: This Repository is Unmaintained

I started this project back in 2003, and stopped maintaining it in 2012. I moved the code here at GitHub in the
hope that a well-maintained fork will emerge.

So you may want to use one of the more recently updated [forks](https://github.com/mirkonasato/jodconverter/network)
instead of this repository. Please don't bother submitting pull requests to this repository as they will simply be ignored.

The previous home for this project is at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/jodconverter/),
including some [wiki pages](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jodconverter/wikis).
