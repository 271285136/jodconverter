# JODConverter

I created this fork because I had to do some changes to the original project and I want to share my work with the community.

## JODConverter

JODConverter (Java OpenDocument Converter) automates document conversions using LibreOffice or OpenOffice.org.

The previous home for this project is at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/jodconverter/),
including some [wiki pages](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jodconverter/wikis).

## Building the Project

```Shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
